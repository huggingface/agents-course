Este quiz √© opcional e n√£o atribui nota.

### Q1: Qual √© uma das principais vantagens de escolher `smolagents` em rela√ß√£o a outros frameworks?
Selecione a alternativa que melhor resume essa for√ßa.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "It uses highly specialized configuration files and a steep learning curve to ensure only expert developers can use it",
    explain: "smolagents is designed for simplicity and minimal code complexity, not steep learning curves.",
  },
  {
    text: "It supports a code-first approach with minimal abstractions, letting agents interact directly via Python function calls",
    explain: "Yes, smolagents emphasizes a straightforward, code-centric design with minimal abstractions.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "It focuses on JSON-based actions, removing the need for agents to write any code",
    explain: "While smolagents supports JSON-based tool calls (ToolCallingAgents), the library emphasizes code-based approaches with CodeAgents.",
  },
  {
    text: "It deeply integrates with a single LLM provider and specialized hardware",
    explain: "smolagents supports multiple model providers and does not require specialized hardware.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q2: Em qual cen√°rio o uso de smolagents traz mais benef√≠cio?
Escolha a situa√ß√£o que mais combina com o prop√≥sito da biblioteca.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "Prototyping or experimenting quickly with agent logic, particularly when your application is relatively straightforward",
    explain: "Yes. smolagents is designed for simple and nimble agent creation without extensive setup overhead.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "Building a large-scale enterprise system where you need dozens of microservices and real-time data pipelines",
    explain: "While possible, smolagents is more focused on lightweight, code-centric experimentation rather than heavy enterprise infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    text: "Needing a framework that only supports cloud-based LLMs and forbids local inference",
    explain: "smolagents offers flexible integration with local or hosted models, not exclusively cloud-based LLMs.",
  },
  {
    text: "A scenario that requires advanced orchestration, multi-modal perception, and enterprise-scale features out-of-the-box",
    explain: "While you can integrate advanced capabilities, smolagents itself is lightweight and minimal at its core.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q3: smolagents oferece flexibilidade na integra√ß√£o de modelos. Qual frase reflete melhor essa abordagem?
Selecione a descri√ß√£o mais precisa sobre interoperabilidade com LLMs.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "It only provides a single built-in model and does not allow custom integrations",
    explain: "smolagents supports multiple different backends and user-defined models.",
  },
  {
    text: "It requires you to implement your own model connector for every LLM usage",
    explain: "There are multiple prebuilt connectors that make LLM integration straightforward.",
  },
  {
    text: "It only integrates with open-source LLMs but not commercial APIs",
    explain: "smolagents can integrate with both open-source and commercial model APIs.",
  },
  {
    text: "It can be used with a wide range of LLMs, offering predefined classes like TransformersModel, InferenceClientModel, and LiteLLMModel",
    explain: "This is correct. smolagents supports flexible model integration through various classes.",
    correct: true
  }
]}
/>

### Q4: Como o smolagents lida com a√ß√µes baseadas em c√≥digo e a√ß√µes baseadas em JSON?
Escolha a op√ß√£o que descreve corretamente a filosofia do framework.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "It only allows JSON-based actions for all agent tasks, requiring a parser to extract the tool calls",
    explain: "ToolCallingAgent uses JSON-based calls, but smolagents also provides a primary CodeAgent option that writes Python code.",
  },
  {
    text: "It focuses on code-based actions via a CodeAgent but also supports JSON-based tool calls with a ToolCallingAgent",
    explain: "Yes, smolagents primarily recommends code-based actions but includes a JSON-based alternative for users who prefer it or need it.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "It disallows any external function calls, instead requiring all logic to reside entirely within the LLM",
    explain: "smolagents is specifically designed to grant LLMs the ability to call tools or code externally.",
  },
  {
    text: "It requires users to manually convert every code snippet into a JSON object before running the agent",
    explain: "smolagents can automatically manage code snippet creation within the CodeAgent path, no manual JSON conversion necessary.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q5: Como o smolagents se integra ao Hugging Face Hub e quais benef√≠cios isso traz?
Assinale a alternativa que descreve corretamente uma vantagem dessa integra√ß√£o.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "It automatically upgrades all public models to commercial license tiers",
    explain: "Hub integration doesn't change the license tier for models or tools.",
  },
  {
    text: "It disables local inference entirely, forcing remote model usage only",
    explain: "Users can still do local inference if they prefer; pushing to the Hub doesn't override local usage.",
  },
  {
    text: "It allows you to push and share agents or tools, making them easily discoverable and reusable by other developers",
    explain: "smolagents supports uploading agents and tools to the HF Hub for others to reuse.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "It permanently stores all your code-based agents, preventing any updates or versioning",
    explain: "Hub repositories support updates and version control, so you can revise your code-based agents any time.",
  }
]}
/>
