# Teste seu entendimento sobre LangGraph

Vamos avaliar o que voc√™ aprendeu sobre `LangGraph` com um quiz r√°pido! Isso ajuda a refor√ßar os conceitos vistos at√© aqui.

Este quiz √© opcional e n√£o possui nota.

### Q1: Qual √© o objetivo principal do LangGraph?
Escolha a afirma√ß√£o que melhor descreve o papel do LangGraph.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "A framework to build control flows for applications containing LLMs",
    explain: "LangGraph is specifically designed to help build and manage the control flow of applications that use LLMs.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "A library that provides interfaces to interact with different LLM models",
    explain: "This better describes LangChain's role, which provides standard interfaces for model interaction. LangGraph focuses on control flow.",
  },
  {
    text: "An Agent library for tool calling",
    explain: "While LangGraph works with agents, the main purpose of langGraph is 'Ochestration'.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q2: No equil√≠brio ‚ÄúControle x Liberdade‚Äù, onde o LangGraph se posiciona?
Qual afirma√ß√£o melhor caracteriza a abordagem do LangGraph ao projetar agentes?

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "LangGraph maximizes freedom, allowing LLMs to make all decisions independently",
    explain: "LangGraph actually focuses more on control than freedom, providing structure for LLM workflows.",
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph provides strong control over execution flow while still leveraging LLM capabilities for decision making",
    explain: "LangGraph shines when you need control over your agent's execution, providing predictable behavior through structured workflows.",
    correct: true
  },
]}
/>

### Q3: Qual √© o papel do State no LangGraph?
Selecione a descri√ß√£o mais precisa.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "State is the latest generation from the LLM",
    explain: "State is a user-defined class in LangGraph, not LLM generated. It's fields are user defined, the values can be LLM filled",
  },
  {
    text: "State is only used to track errors during execution",
    explain: "State has a much broader purpose than just error tracking. But that's still usefull.",
  },
  {
    text: "State represents the information that flows through your agent application",
    explain: "State is central to LangGraph and contains all the information needed for decision-making between steps. You provide the fields than you need to compute and the nodes can alter the values to decide on a branching.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "State is only relevant when working with external APIs",
    explain: "State is fundamental to all LangGraph applications, not just those working with external APIs.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q4: O que √© uma Conditional Edge no LangGraph?
Escolha a op√ß√£o mais correta.

<Question
choices={[
    {
    text: "An edge that determines which node to execute next based on evaluating a condition",
    explain: "Conditional edges allow your graph to make dynamic routing decisions based on the current state, creating branching logic in your workflow.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "An edge that is only followed when a specific condition occurs",
    explain: "Conditional edges control the flow of the application on it's outputs, not on the input.",
  },
  {
    text: "An edge that requires user confirmation before proceeding",
    explain: "Conditional edges are based on programmatic conditions, not user interaction requirements.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q5: Como o LangGraph ajuda a lidar com alucina√ß√µes de LLMs?
Escolha a melhor resposta.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "LangGraph eliminates hallucinations entirely by limiting LLM responses",
    explain: "No framework can completely eliminate hallucinations from LLMs, LangGraph is no exception.",
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph provides structured workflows that can validate and verify LLM outputs",
    explain: "By creating structured workflows with validation steps, verification nodes, and error handling paths, LangGraph helps reduce the impact of hallucinations.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph has no effect on hallucinations",
    explain: "LangGraph's structured approach to workflows can help significantly in mitigating hallucinations at the cost of speed.",
  }
]}
/>
