## Using API Keys in Google Colab

When working with the notebooks in this course, you'll need to use API keys for various services. Here's how to securely store and access them in Google Colab:

### How to Set Up and Use Secret Keys:

1. **Access the Secrets Manager**: Click on the key icon in the left sidebar to access the secret keys manager
2. **Create a New Secret**: Name your key (without spaces) and enter your API key value
3. **Make the Secret Available**: Click the checkbox to share the secret with your notebook
4. **Access in Your Code**: Use this code snippet to access your secret in the notebook:

```python
from google.colab import userdata
api_key = userdata.get('<your-scretkey-name-here>')
```

## API Tips

### Together.ai

Signing up for an API key at [together.ai](https://www.together.ai/) gives you access to $1 free credit for API use. 

To use your Together.ai API key, modify the code in the notebook from:

```python
model = HfApiModel(model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct", provider="together")
```

To:

```python
model = HfApiModel(model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct", provider="together", token=api_key)
```

This will significantly speed up the process.

### Alternative Models

If you encounter query limits or usage restrictions from Together.ai with DeepSeek R1, you can switch models:

From:
```python
model = HfApiModel(model_id="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1", provider="together")
```

To:
```python
model = HfApiModel(model_id="mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1", provider="together")
```
