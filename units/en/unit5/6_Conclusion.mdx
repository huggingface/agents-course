# Conclusion

**Congratulations** on completing the Gradio for AI Agents module! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

Throughout these five units, you've learned how to create powerful and intuitive user interfaces for your AI Agents. You started with simple chat interfaces and progressed to complex, multi-agent systems with advanced visualization capabilities.

Let's recap what you've accomplished:

- In Unit 1, you learned the fundamentals of Gradio and why it's perfect for building Agent UIs
- In Unit 2, you created your first Agent interface using ChatInterface and saw how to display an Agent's thought process
- In Unit 3, you mastered advanced visualization techniques with ChatMessage for showing tool usage and nested reasoning
- In Unit 4, you integrated the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect your interface with external tools
- In Unit 5, you built a complete agentic UI using smolagents with file uploads, Sidebars, Deeplinks and Multiple pages

These skills give you everything you need to build professional-grade interfaces for your AI Agents.

With Gradio, you can transform any AI Agent from a command-line tool into a fully interactive application that can be shared with users of all technical backgrounds.

## What's Next?
Now that you have these Gradio skills, consider exploring:
- Deploying your Agent UIs to Hugging Face Spaces for wider access
- Building specialized interfaces for domain-specific Agents
- Combining multiple Agents in a single interface
